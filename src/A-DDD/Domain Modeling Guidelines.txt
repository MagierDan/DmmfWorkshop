## Domain modelling guidelines

* Start with the events
* What data is needed?
  * From the event itself
  * From the current state of the system
  * What is optional vs. required?
* What are the output events?
  * For broadcast to downsteam systems 
* What is the change in system state? 
  * Is this a state transition?
* What are the side effects?
  * Things that must be done but are internal to the domain
* What can go wrong?
  * Model success or failure with an OR choice

* If you hear "it depends", drill deeper
* Disagreement between experts is OK. The design process is about getting *everyone* on the same page.
* Everyone must be in the room. Otherwise they miss being part of the process. It's not just about the results of the process

Example
====================

Workflow: "Place order"
triggered by:
  "Order form received" event
primary input:
  An order form
other input/dependencies:
  Product catalog
output events:
  "Order Placed" event
side-effects:
  An acknowledgment is sent to the customer,
  along with the placed order

data Order =
  CustomerInfo
  AND ShippingAddress
  AND BillingAddress
  AND list of OrderLines
  AND AmountToBill

data OrderLine =
  Product
  AND OrderQuantity 
  AND Price

data OrderQuantity = 
  UnitQuantity 
  OR KilogramQuantity

data UnitQuantity = integer between 1 and ?
data KilogramQuantity = decimal between ? and ?

data CustomerInfo = CustomerName AND ContactInfo 
data BillingAddress = ??? // don't know yet

data CustomerName = FirstName AND LastName

data ContactInfo =
  EmailAddress
  OR PhoneNumber
